# ai-phishing-url-detector
A no-code machine learning project that detects phishing URLs using an AI model trained via Google AutoML or Teachable Machine.

# AI-Powered Phishing URL Detector 🛡️🔗

This project uses a no-code machine learning model to detect whether a given URL is likely to be **phishing** or **safe**.

## 🚀 How It Works
We use a machine learning model trained on examples of phishing and non-phishing URLs. The trained model is integrated with a no-code frontend (Bubble.io) to allow users to input a URL and get instant results.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- [Google AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl) or [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com)
- [Bubble.io](https://bubble.io) (for frontend)
- GitHub (for version control)
- Replit (for optional backend API)
- Figma or Canva (for UI design)
